<h1>we are the tiny corp</h1>

<p>We write and maintain <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad">tinygrad</a>, the fastest growing neural network framework (over 9000 GitHub stars)<p>

<p>It's extremely simple, and breaks down the most <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/examples/llama.py">complex</a> <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/examples/stable_diffusion.py">networks</a> into 4 <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/ops.py">OpTypes</a></p>

<li><b>UnaryOps</b> operate on one tensor and run elementwise. RELU, LOG, RECIPROCAL, etc...</li>
<li><b>BinaryOps</b> operate on two tensors and run elementwise to return one. ADD, MUL, etc...</li>
<li><b>ReduceOps</b> operate on one tensor and return a smaller tensor. SUM, MAX</li>
<li><b>MovementOps</b> operate on one tensor and move the data around, copy-free with <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/shape/shapetracker.py">ShapeTracker</a>. RESHAPE, PERMUTE, EXPAND, etc...</li>

<p>But how...where are your CONVs and MATMULs? Read the code to solve this mystery.</p>

We are <b>hiring</b>. All jobs are full time and on site in San Diego. No remote. Very talented interns okay. Same as <a href="https://www.comma.ai/jobs">comma</a>.<br/><br/>

<li>2x Software Engineer -- Python, C++, C. Beautiful elegant short code. From Pythonic AI framework down to twiddling GPU registers.</li>

Do you know how computers work? Do you <i>actually</i> <a href="https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor">know how computers work?</a><br/>
Can you build a motherboard? Can you write a GPU driver?<br/><br/>

<i>work@tinygrad.org</i> to apply. Together, we will push the limits of computing. First by getting AMD cards on <a href="https://mlcommons.org/en/training-normal-21/">MLPerf</a><br/>

<p>FAQ:</p>

<em>Is tinygrad used anywhere?</em><br/></br>
tinygrad is used in <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a> to run the driving model on the Snapdragon 845 GPU. It replaces <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/sites/default/files/docs/snpe/overview.html">SNPE</a>, is faster, supports loading onnx files, supports training, and allows for attention (SNPE only allows fixed weights).
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>Is tinygrad inference only?</em><br/></br>
No! It supports full forward and backward passes with autodiff. <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/mlops.py">This</a> is implemented at a level of abstraction higher than the accelerator specific code, so a tinygrad port gets you this for free.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>How can I use tinygrad for my next ML project?</em><br/></br>
Follow the installation instructions on <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad">the tinygrad repo</a>. It has a similar API to PyTorch, yet simpler and more refined. Less stable though while tinygrad is in alpha, so be warned, though it's been fairly stable for a while.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>When will tinygrad leave alpha?</em><br/></br>
When we can reproduce a common set of papers on 1 NVIDIA GPU 2x faster than PyTorch. We also want the speed to be good on the M1. ETA, Q2 next year.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>How is tinygrad faster than PyTorch?</em><br/></br>
For most use cases it isn't yet, but it will be. It has three advantages:
<li>It compiles a custom kernel for every operation, allowing extreme shape specialization.</li>
<li>All tensors are lazy, so it can aggressively fuse operations.</li>
<li>The backend is 10x+ simpler, meaning optimizing one kernel makes everything fast.</li>

<em>How can the tiny corp work for me?</em><br/></br>

Email me, george@tinygrad.org. We are looking for contracts and sponsorships to improve various aspects of tinygrad.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>How can I work for the tiny corp?</em><br/></br>

See <b>hiring</b> above. Contributions to <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad">tinygrad</a> on GitHub always welcome, and a good way to get hired.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>Can I invest in the tiny corp?</em><br/></br>

Invest with your PRs.

<br/><br/><br/>

<em>What's the goal of the tiny corp?</em><br/></br>

To accelerate. We will commoditize the petaflop and enable AI for everyone.
