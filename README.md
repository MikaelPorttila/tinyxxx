# we are the tiny corp

* Do you find yourself millions of dollars in the hole building an AI accelerator chip?
* Jumped the gun and built hardware before you had the software ready?
* Have a SoC with a hard to use Neural Network SDK? (Qualcomm, Rockchip)
* Just wish your accelerator was faster? (NVIDIA, Google)

The tiny corp can help. We can port our framework to any accelerator.
